## Custom tile sets
- `1.1x` --> upscaled by 1.1 to avoid NASPA Zyzzyva's weird bug.
- to use them paste them into `data/tiles` folder in the installation directory.
	- ex: `C:\Program Files\NASPA Zyzzyva 3.4.1\data\tiles`

## Aerolith list to Zyzzyva
- run `./aerolith/scripty.py` then enter the file name;
- or just run the `aero-to-zyzzyva-windows.exe` (windows only)
- as an example: 4s-08-25.txt
- then import the `stripped-4s-08-25.txt` file in to zyzzyva.
